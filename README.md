# Better user auth for Node JS

This is some example/boilerplate code for creating an API with standard user auth using JWT (Javascript Web Tokens).

# Features/user stories:
- Register a new account
- Login and receive a JWT
- Sign out of all sessions (revokes JWTs)
- Change password while signed in
- Forgot password (send a reset link)
- Reset password (with a reset link)
- `verifyToken` for making sure a user is logged in
